# Relevant Projects and Experiences

## Undergraduate Researcher, [Huang Lab at UCSF](https://scvrb-core.ucsf.edu/~huang/lab/Research.html)
* Conducting bioinformatics research on cardiac regeneration under Prof. Guo Huang using Geneformer, a transformer-based foundation model for single-cell genomics
* Developing scalable pipelines in Python using Geneformer, Scanpy, and Torch for embedding extraction, perturbation simulation, and downstream statistical analysis
* Working with single-cell RNA-seq data to analyze perturbation effects, identify candidate regulatory genes, and simulate transcriptional shifts
* Testing model generalization across pretrained architectures, label-based perturbation via GeneClassifier, and hyperparameter tuning for fine-tuned embeddings
