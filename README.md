## Relevant Projects and Experiences

#### Quantitative Analyst Intern @ TechSharpe Quant Capital Management
*	Built OLS regression models using Python and statsmodels to neutralize industry and size exposures in alpha factor returns, using daily equity data spanning 5 years
*	Engineered and cleaned large-scale multi-index financial datasets, handling look-ahead bias and missing data with Pandas and NumPy
*	Evaluated model performance using RÂ², Sharpe ratio, Information Coefficient (IC), and Information Ratio (IR), and performed decile analysis on stock rankings by alpha
*	Used deep learning models like AlphaNet for alpha signal generation, including the use of autoencoders and recurrent neural networks in financial time-series forecasting


#### Undergraduate Researcher @ [Huang Lab at UCSF](https://scvrb-core.ucsf.edu/~huang/lab/Research.html)
*	Conducting bioinformatics research on cardiac regeneration under Prof. Guo Huang using Geneformer, a transformer-based foundation model for single-cell genomics
*	Developing scalable pipelines in Python using Geneformer, Scanpy, and Torch for embedding extraction, perturbation simulation, and downstream statistical analysis
*	Working with single-cell RNA-seq data to analyze perturbation effects, identify candidate regulatory genes, and simulate transcriptional shifts
* Performing systematic hyperparameter tuning to adapt Geneformer to cardiac-specific cell types, optimizing embedding quality and model generalization
