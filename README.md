## Work Experience

#### Quantitative Analyst Intern @ TechSharpe Quant Capital Management 
###### (***Dec 2024 - Present***)
*	Built OLS regression models using **Python** and statsmodels to neutralize industry and size exposures in alpha factor returns, using daily equity data spanning 5 years
*	Engineered and cleaned large-scale multi-index financial datasets, handling look-ahead bias and missing data with **Pandas** and **NumPy**
*	Evaluated model performance using RÂ², Sharpe ratio, Information Coefficient (IC), and Information Ratio (IR), and performed decile analysis on stock rankings by alpha
*	Trianed deep learning models like AlphaNet for alpha signal generation, using **PyTorch** and **Lightning**


#### Undergraduate Researcher @ [Huang Lab at UCSF](https://scvrb-core.ucsf.edu/~huang/lab/Research.html)
###### (***Jan 2025 - Present***)
*	Conducting computational biology research on cardiac regeneration under Prof. Guo Huang using Geneformer, a transformer-based foundation model for single-cell genomics
*	Developing scalable pipelines in Python using Geneformer, **Scanpy**, and **PyTorch** for embedding extraction, perturbation simulation, and downstream statistical analysis
*	Working with single-cell RNA-seq data to analyze perturbation effects, identify candidate regulatory genes, and simulate transcriptional shifts
* Performing systematic hyperparameter tuning to adapt Geneformer to cardiac-specific cell types, optimizing embedding quality and model generalization


## Projects

#### Discovering Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Subtypes with Gene Expression Data using Machine Learning
[Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11jV82yGMEHr77B_zYCY7HzYi8-tEApct/view?usp=sharing)
* **Finalist and special award recipient at 2022 ISEF**, and participant in the 2023 Science Talent Search.
* Leading end-to-end ML research to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer subtypes using RNA-seq gene expression datasets
*	Applied Elastic Net Regression to select predictive gene features, iterating models over 500+ training rounds to isolate consistent subtype-specific gene markers
*	Performed dimensionality reduction with PCA and LDA to visualize separability of cancer subtypes, confirming biological patterns in subtype aggressiveness
*	Used STRING and DAVID bioinformatics tools to analyze protein-protein interactions and enriched Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways

#### Computational Prediction of Biological Signatures for Candidate Driver Genes Associated with Ovarian Cancer
[IEEE Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9669275)
* Identified potential driver genes for ovarian cancer using various computational tools 

#### Sheets2MIDI
* Leading the design and implementation of a deep learning pipeline using CNNs and RNNs to perform Optical Music Recognition (OMR) and convert scanned sheet music into MIDI audio files
* Building a preprocessing pipeline with **OpenCV** to denoise, binarize, and segment musical symbols from raw image data
* Directing full-stack development of a web application enabling users to upload sheet music and receive MIDI outputs
* Overseeing model evaluation (e.g., note accuracy, rhythm reconstruction) and iterating on architecture to improve conversion fidelity
* Designing system architecture with support for RESTful API integration to enable scalable programmatic access
